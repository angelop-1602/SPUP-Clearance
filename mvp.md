2. In console, run:
```javascript
// Import the function first (if not already imported)
import { createAdminUser } from '/src/utils/createAdmin.ts';
createAdminUser('your_secure_password').then(() => console.log('Admin created!'));
```

### **Firebase Setup Required**

## 🔐 FIREBASE RULES (Pseudocode)

```js
match /submissions/{id} {
  allow read, write: if request.auth != null &&
    (request.auth.token.email == "cprint@spup.edu.ph");
}
match /{allPaths=**} {
  allow read, write: if false; // lock everything else
}
```

## ✅ ADDITIONAL FEATURES

* ✅ Public submission tracking (with submission ID)
* Email notifications on status update
* Admin-level roles (chair, dean, adviser)
* CSV Export
* Check `.zip` contents server-side (Node.js Function)

### 🔍 Public Submission Tracking

Students can now track their submission status using their ID:

* **Route:** `/track`
* **Input:** Submission ID validation (`SPUP_Clearance_YYYY_ABC123`)
* **Display:** Status, submission details, next steps
* **Access:** Public (no login required)
* **Features:**
  * ID format validation
  * Real-time status display
  * Visual status indicators
  * Next steps guidance
  * Navigation to submit new requests

### 📦 Individual Download System

Cost optimization feature for managing Firebase Storage:

* **Purpose:** Download individual submission files and automatically remove from storage to save costs
* **Functionality:**
  * ✅ Individual submission download with custom naming: `(StudentName)_SPUP_Clearance_YYYY_ABC123.zip`
  * ✅ Automatic storage cleanup after successful download
  * ✅ Firebase Storage integration using SDK (CORS-free)
  * ✅ Metadata retention in Firestore with `isExported` and `exportedAt` fields
  * ✅ **Visual indicators in admin table for exported submissions**

### 🎨 Visual Export Indicators

✅ **Added visual flags for exported submissions:**

* **Desktop Table:** Green "Archived" badge with download icon next to status
* **Mobile Cards:** Stacked layout with status and archive indicator
* **Tooltip:** Shows export date on hover
* **Styling:** Green background (`bg-green-100 text-green-800`) for clear distinction
* **Icon:** Download arrow icon to represent archived/exported status

### 🔧 CORS Issue Resolution

✅ **Fixed Firebase Storage CORS blocking with native browser downloads:**

**Problem:** Firebase Storage was blocking programmatic `fetch()` requests due to CORS policy, even with signed URLs.

**Final Solution:** **Streamlined automatic individual downloads** with smart browser handling:
* ✅ **Individual Downloads:** Each submission downloads separately with proper student names
* ✅ **Student Name Format:** `(StudentName)SPUP_Clearance_YYYY_ABC123.zip`
* ✅ **CORS Bypass:** Uses native browser download mechanism with signed Firebase URLs
* ✅ **Smart Automation:** Automatic downloads with intelligent delays to prevent browser blocking
* ✅ **User Confirmation:** Preview all files before download with user consent
* ✅ **Progress Tracking:** Real-time progress display with current file being downloaded
* ✅ **Staggered Timing:** 1s delay after first download, 2s between subsequent downloads
* ✅ **Professional UX:** Single click initiates all downloads with clear feedback

**Technical Implementation:**
```typescript
// Streamlined bulk download with automatic intervals
export async function bulkExportSubmissions(submissions, options, onProgress) {
  // 1. Prepare all signed URLs first
  const downloadData = [];
  for (const submission of submissions) {
    const downloadURL = await getDownloadURL(fileRef);
    const fileName = `(${sanitizedName})${submission.id}.zip`;
    downloadData.push({ fileName, downloadURL });
  }

  // 2. Show preview and get user confirmation
  const userConfirm = confirm(`Ready to download ${downloadData.length} files:\n\n• ${fileList}`);
  
  // 3. Auto-download with smart delays
  for (let i = 0; i < downloadData.length; i++) {
    const link = document.createElement('a');
    link.href = downloadURL;
    link.download = fileName;
    link.click();
    
    onProgress(i + 1, total, fileName); // Update UI progress
    await delay(i === 0 ? 1000 : 2000); // Smart staggering
  }
}
```

**Final Resolution:** Firebase Storage CORS is fundamentally incompatible with programmatic client-side downloads. The optimal solution is intelligent individual downloads with browser-native mechanisms, proper delays, and excellent UX.

### 🔧 Multi-Download Issue Resolution

✅ **Fixed bulk download problem when selecting all submissions:**

**Problem:** Bulk export was only downloading one file due to filename mismatch
**Root Cause:** Export service was using old filename format (`${submission.id}.zip`) instead of new format (`${studentName}_${submission.id}.zip`)
**Solution:** Updated both `bulkExportSubmissions` and `downloadSubmissionFile` functions to use new filename format
**Result:** Multi-download now works correctly for all selected submissions

**Files Updated:**
- `src/services/exportService.ts` - Simplified to individual download functionality
- `src/components/admin/AdminTable.tsx` - Added EllipsisVertical dropdown with View/Download actions
- `src/app/admin/page.tsx` - Removed Export & Archive button and ExportPanel
- `src/components/admin/ExportPanel.tsx` - **DELETED** (no longer needed)

### 🚀 EllipsisVertical Dropdown Menu System

✅ **Implemented ShadCN dropdown menu with EllipsisVertical icon:**

**New Approach:** Clean dropdown menu (⋮) for each submission with View and Download options
**Benefits:**
- **Professional UI:** Modern dropdown menu design using ShadCN components
- **Space Efficient:** Single icon button instead of multiple action buttons
- **Better UX:** Organized actions in a clean dropdown interface
- **Automatic Cleanup:** Files are removed from storage after download to save costs

**Technical Implementation:**
- **ShadCN Dropdown:** Uses @radix-ui/react-dropdown-menu for accessibility and styling
- **EllipsisVertical Icon:** Clean three-dot menu icon from Lucide React
- **Individual Actions:** View and Download options for each submission
- **Automatic Cleanup:** Files automatically removed from Firebase Storage after successful download

**Actions Available:**
- **View:** Shows submission details and metadata in an alert
- **Download:** Downloads file and automatically removes from storage (disabled for already downloaded files). Now validates file fetch before deletion to prevent data loss on errors. ✅
- **Mark All as Exported:** Bulk operation to clean up all files

**Smart Download Management:**
- **Download Button:** Automatically disabled once file is downloaded
- **Visual Feedback:** Shows "Already Downloaded" for exported submissions
- **Prevents Duplicates:** Users cannot attempt to download already exported files
- **Mobile Support:** Download buttons also disabled in mobile card view

**UI Components Added:**
- `src/components/ui/dropdown-menu.tsx` - ShadCN dropdown menu component
- Updated AdminTable with EllipsisVertical dropdown interface
- Removed Export & Archive button from main admin dashboard
